## Distinguish traits and "functional traits"

Definition of trait as per [@Violle2007] - "a trait is any morphological, physiological or phenological fea- ture measurable at the individual level, from the cell to the whole-organism level, without reference to the environment or any other level of organization".

Continuing with [@Violle2007], we can borrow their idea that a measure of a trait at a give place and time is called an **attribute**. 
The average (or some other statistic/ calculation) of the **attributes** can be considered the trait value for a population. 
Population could be defined as a species, a group in a particular location, etc. 
In this way we can understand / address the idea of **Trait by species**.
A species does not have a specific trait value, but rather an aggregate of some kind of the trait attributes.
This is even the case for many categorical trait values.
For example, serotiny (the closure of the cones) may show some degree of variation, even in species classified as "serotiness".
